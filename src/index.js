import Gameboard from "./backend/Gameboard.js";

// store gameboard as an array in a Gameboard object

// players stored in their own object

// an object to control game flow

// get game working in console first, then apply to front end... forgot about this approach

// thingy to check win state

// once console game is working, create thingy to handle UI (display & DOM logic)

const gameboard = new Gameboard();
console.log(gameboard.board);
